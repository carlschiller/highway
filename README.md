Simulating traffic flow at Roslags Näsby trafikplats in Täby, Sweden as a part of KTH course work in SI1336. Model of road is constructed by using a directed graph with vertices spaced approximately every 30
meters. Cars are simulated by traversing the graph with a time step size of 1/60th of a second.
