\section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Problem formulation}
    This project is intended to simulate the traffic flow effect of a \textit{time fixed ramp
    meter} a freeway
    on-ramp in Roslags NÃ¤sby trafikplats, Sweden. A \textit{ramp meter} is a device that
    manages the flow of traffic onto the freeway, an example of a \textit{ramp meter} can be seen in figure \ref{pic:ramp}.
    More specifically, a \textit{time fixed ramp
    meter} that only allow one car per green signal period will be examined. There are also
    more active variants of \textit{ramp meters} which measure gaps in the traffic on the freeway
    to determine when to release vehicles, but this is beyond the scope of this project.
    Ramp metering systems have successfuly been proven to decrease congestion and
    reduce travel time on freeways.

      \label{pic:ramp}
    \end{figure}
  \subsection{Complex systems}
    Traffic flow is a typical example of a complex system. As described in \textit{An Introduction to Computer Simulation Methods Third Edition (revised)},
    traffic flow can be simulated by modelling the system as a \textit{Cellular Automaton}. A \textit{Cellular Automaton} is a
    grid lattice which changes state on each tick based on rules and the current configuration of the lattice. \cite{gould_introduction_nodate}
\section{Method}
  \textit{Cellular Automata} was determined to not be satisfactory when trying to model the flow of the freeway.
  This is because lane change and collision detection worked poorly on a grid lattice in two dimensions. Another
  approach was considered instead.

  \subsection{Graphs}
  \begin{multicols}{2}
    In order to model the road with several lanes, a \textit{directed graph} was
    implemented with blocks of vertices as lanes, with directed edges as paths
    for the cars to drive. In other terms, cars drive on ''rails'' and can
    only change lanes on specified vertices, as can be seen in figure \ref{pic:graph}. \cite{noauthor_gerichteter_2018}

    When using a \textit{directed graph} instead of a grid lattice, collision avoidance becomes a lot easier
    to implement. Time complexity also decreases, which improves simulation performance.
    The collision avoidance method inmplemented is $\mathcal{O}(n\cdot m^{2})$, where $n$ is the amount of cars and $m$ is the
    search area. The grid lattice as previously metioned had dimensions 550x600, which was replaced
    by a graph with approximately 140 edges which improved performance by approximately
    2000 times (if the whole system is searched for potential obstructions i.e. other cars).

        \label{pic:graph}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}
  \end{multicols}

  \subsection{Discretization}
    In contrast to \textit{Cellular Automata}
    there is no grid discretization, and thus the cars run on continuous ''tracks''.
    The distance traveled by each car is determined by the individual car's speed and
    the system wide time step size.
    Another benefit from the \textit{directed graph} implementation is that
    the directions of the cars is not required as a parameter. All that is needed in
    order to simulate a car is the speed and the distance
    to the next vertex as well as knowing which vertex the car originated from.
    When stepping in time the distance traveled is subtracted from the distance to the next vertex, and
    when the car has reached the next vertex a new target vertex is selected.

    Cars make decisions independently according to simple rules, and generates
    a complex behavior when interacting with each other i.e. braking or changing lanes.
    Some parameters are tweakable without changing the code, and each parameter
    influences the simulation in different ways.
    \subsubsection{Speed}
      The cars' speed is determined by a mean speed multiplied by a normally distributed
      variable $x \in N(1,\sigma)$, which is referred to in the code as
      ''m\_aggressiveness''. ''m\_aggressiveness'' is also involved collision detection
      and to determine when to overtake the car in front. $\sigma$ is user tweakable.
    \subsubsection{Spawn rate and car headway}
      Cars appear in two segments, either on the on-ramp or on the beginning of the freeway.
      The rate of
      which cars appear on freeways is determined by a gamma distribution
      with probability density function according to equation \ref{eq:1}. \cite{abdel-rahim_ce571:_nodate}
      \begin{equation}
        f(t) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha)\beta^{\alpha}}x^{\alpha-1}e^{-x/\beta}
        \label{eq:1}
      \end{equation}
      where $\alpha$ is the ''shape'' factor and $\beta$ is the ''rate'' factor which are
      tweakable according to which behavior is sought after. The expected mean of a
      stochastic varaiable is $\alpha\beta$, with variance $\alpha\beta^{2}$.
      This means, a larger $\beta$ implies a more spread out function.
    \subsubsection{Collision detection}
      If a car is too close to a car in front, the speed is reduced according the following rules.
      \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
      if (radius_to_car < ideal && delta_speed < 0 && radius_to_car > min_distance) {
          m_speed -= std::min(std::max((radius_to_car-min_distance)*0.5f,0.0f),10.0f*delta_t);
      }
      else if(radius_to_car < min_distance){
          m_speed -= std::min(std::max((min_distance-radius_to_car)*0.5f,0.0f),2.0f*delta_t);
      }
      else if(delta_speed < 0 && radius_to_car < detection_distance){
          m_speed -= std::min(
                  abs(pow(delta_speed, 2.0f)) * pow(ideal * 0.25f / radius_to_car, 2.0f) * m_aggressiveness * 0.15f,
                  10.0f * delta_t);
      }
      \end{lstlisting}
      This ensures that a car slowly approaches the car in front. The first if statement
      guarantees that it will not surpass the ''min\_distance'' distance, because the
      speed reduction follows this diverging sum.
      \begin{equation}
        d - \sum_{n = 2}^{\infty} \frac{d}{n^{2}} = 0
      \end{equation}
      where $d$ is ''radius\_to\_car-min\_distance''.
    \subsubsection{Acceleration}
      If no obstruction is in the way, a car will accelerate according to:
      \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
      float target = m_target_speed;
      float d_vel; // proportional control.

      if(m_speed < target*0.75){
          d_vel = m_aggressiveness*elapsed*2.0f;
      }
      else{
          d_vel = m_aggressiveness*(target-m_speed)*4*elapsed*2.0f;
      }

      m_speed += d_vel;
      \end{lstlisting}

    \subsubsection{Overtake logic and merging}
      A car decides to overtake another car if the following conditions are met.
      \begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
          //see if we want to overtake car.

       if(closest_car != nullptr){
           //float delta_speed = closest_car->speed()-speed();
           float delta_distance = Util::distance_to_car(this,closest_car);

           if(overtake_this_car == nullptr){
               if(delta_distance > m_min_overtake_dist_trigger && delta_distance < m_max_overtake_dist_trigger && (target_speed()/closest_car->target_speed() > m_aggressiveness*1.0f ) && current_lane == 0 && closest_car->current_node->get_parent_segment()->get_lane_number(closest_car->current_node) == 0){
                   overtake_this_car = closest_car;
               }
           }

       }

       if(overtake_this_car !=nullptr){
           if(Util::is_car_behind(overtake_this_car,this) && (Util::distance_to_car(this,overtake_this_car) > m_overtake_done_dist)){
               overtake_this_car = nullptr;
           }
       }
      \end{lstlisting}
      A car will not merge if another car is occupying the lane it want to switch too.
  \subsection{Graphics rendering}
    When tweaking parameters involved in the cars' descision making, it is hard to
    get an overview of how each parameter influences the system wide behavior of the
    traffic. Thus a lot of effort has been spent on developing a graphical interface
    that shows how the traffic flows in the given configuration of parameters.
    An example of a test run is shown in the link below.
